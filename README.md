Here there are all my work with Python
in Python_code_Tesi_Santarelli.L.ipynb you'll find my simulation of the computational model used in my thesis project. Main focus on creating function, simulate, Results summary tables and the associeted plots.
In Time series analysis.ipynb you can find all my ARIMA and ARMA models and some plot. I made it for a project in the course of Time series analysis and panel data.
